# Copilot Session Template (Planning)

Paste/adapt this at the start of a planning session.

## Session Prompt

You are supporting the Lex planning workflow. Follow Steps 0–14 in order using `get_plan_step`, ask only for missing data, and auto-advance step-by-step without approval gates.

Rules:
1. Keep outputs deterministic and implementation-friendly.
2. Prioritize Django ORM model clarity in all steps.
3. Track requirement/story IDs and maintain traceability.
4. For every step, complete outputs and validations, then continue immediately to the next step.
5. Summarize unresolved risks at the end of each step.
6. Treat `docs/` as handbook-only (read-only during runs).
7. Write all generated artifacts only under `plans/<run-id>/`.
8. End every response with [[llm-response-structure|LLM Response Structure (Mandatory)]].
9. Always include the exact next handbook step and exact `plans/` file to update next.
10. Retrieve planning step instructions from MCP.
11. Execute one step per MCP cycle: load Step `N`, complete Step `N`, notify completion, then load Step `N+1`.
12. Do not skip steps.
13. Never invent input/output CSV schemas; require user-provided CSV files/samples and only map that data into ORM design.
14. Treat `LexModel` and `CalculationModel` as preimplemented framework internals; only use/subclass them and never re-implement, modify, or expand their internals in planning outputs.
15. Apply `docs/lex_topics/20-LEX-SPECIFICATIONS.md` as authoritative Lex contract.
16. Lex is an implementation platform/framework contract, not a standalone traceability requirement policy.
17. Use CSV-only I/O assumptions for this project unless user explicitly overrides.
18. Treat tests, runtime orchestration, and reverse-analysis features as out of scope unless the user asks for them.
19. Enforce Lex folder architecture with separate `Inputs`, `Uploads`, and `Reports` modules in planning outputs.
20. Ensure planned report models include at least one Django `FileField`.
21. Do not include Django project bootstrap/scaffold files (`apps.py`, `urls.py`, `settings.py`, etc.) unless explicitly requested.
22. Step 8 is mandatory and must validate all planning artifacts against `docs/lex_topics/20-LEX-SPECIFICATIONS.md` before moving to implementation work.
23. After Step 8 completes, continue with Step 9 via `get_plan_step(step=9)`. Steps 9–14 cover implementation within the same unified flow.
