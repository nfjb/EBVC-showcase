# Lex MCP Modes

Use this file as the canonical quick guide for mode switching across Lex MCP servers.

If you are an AI agent and you need more context before switching modes, read this file first instead of relying on long tool descriptions.

## AI Quickview (Read This First)

**`brief` is the default mode and the front door.** It is where a session starts
when nothing says otherwise, because which kind of run the user needs is something
to establish rather than assume. Brief interviews them, writes `.lex/contract.md`,
and switches to the mode the answer names — `finalize_brief` returns it in
`hands_off_to`. Every mode can switch back to `brief`, and should when the user's
next request belongs somewhere else.

Use the table below when the user's intent matches one row plainly: switch there
and get on with it. Brief exists to settle an open question, not to be a toll
booth on a clear one. When the request is vague, or spans rows, or the mode it
implies would need requirements the user has not stated, go through `brief`.

| User Intent (Plain English) | Correct Mode | Do Not Use | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Help me work out what I need" / "interview me" / "write the spec or prompt" | `brief` | `forward`, `mvp_generator` | Produces the project contract by interviewing the user. Nothing is built. |
| "Build a new app from scratch" | `forward` | `edit`, `review`, `test`, `backward`, `mvp_completion` | Full end-to-end project creation flow. |
| "Build only an MVP quickly" | `mvp_generator` | `edit`, `review`, `mvp_completion` | Reduced-scope forward workflow for MVP delivery. |
| "Complete the MVP" / "upgrade MVP to full product" | `mvp_completion` | `edit`, `mvp_generator` | Completion mode exists specifically for MVP -> full-product expansion. |
| "Modify existing project" / "implement targeted change" | `edit` | `forward`, `mvp_generator`, `mvp_completion` | Focused edits on an already existing Lex project. Branches, commits each task, and opens a pull request; it never merges. |
| "Review/audit existing project" | `review` | `edit`, `forward` | Produces review artifacts, not implementation changes. |
| "The input format changed" / "the columns are different now" / "new CSV layout" / "adapt the app to the new data" | `input` | `edit`, `review` | Migrates the app's hand-written input parsing and downstream code to a changed input-data format. |
| "Deploy this" / "get it running on the server" / "set it up on staging" / "ship it to production" | `deploy` | `forward`, `edit` | Runs the Lex deployment handbook against an app that already exists and proves it runs. Writes no application code. |
| "Write tests" / "test this app" / "are these tests any good" | `test` | `review`, `edit` | Writes the test suite and proves it catches regressions. Requires user stories to exist first. |
| "Document an existing project" / "reverse document" | `backward` | `forward`, `edit`, `review` | Reverse documentation and migration workflow. |

### Priority Disambiguation Rules (AI)

1. If user says "MVP" and "complete", "finish", "expand", or "full product", choose `mvp_completion`.
2. If user says "MVP" and asks to create/build initial version only, choose `mvp_generator`.
3. If user asks for implementation changes in an existing repo and does not mention MVP upgrade, choose `edit`.
4. Never choose `edit` for MVP completion requests.
5. If the user asks for tests, test data, or test coverage, choose `test` — not
   `edit`. Test mode owns the JSON scenario-data paradigm and the effectiveness
   audit; `edit`'s tests task only patches tests for a change it just made.
6. If the user asks whether existing tests are any good, choose `test` — its
   effectiveness audit is the only surface that answers that.
7. If the user reports a changed input-data format (renamed/added/dropped
   columns, new delimiter or encoding, new row grain, restructured upload
   files), choose `input` — NOT `edit`. `edit` is for feature or behavior
   changes; `review` is a read-only audit and changes nothing.
8. `brief` is the default and needs no trigger phrase. Choose it whenever the
   user is unclear about what they want, asks for help planning or specifying,
   spans more than one row of the table, or names a mode whose run would need
   requirements they have not stated. Brief interviews them, writes
   `.lex/contract.md`, and hands off to the mode the answers name. Switch
   straight to a build mode only when they have plainly said which one they want
   — and if you find yourself about to guess which, that *is* the case for
   `brief`.
9. If the user wants a working app *running somewhere* — a server, a container,
   staging, production — choose `deploy`, not `forward` or `edit`. Deploy mode
   configures and runs; it does not write application code. If the deployment
   exposes a code defect, finish recording it and switch to `edit`.
10. Ask one clarification question only when intent matches multiple rows.

### Fast Intent Examples

- "Please complete this MVP to production quality" -> `mvp_completion`
- "Generate an MVP for this idea" -> `mvp_generator`
- "Refactor this existing Lex app and add OAuth" -> `edit`
- "Run a code quality audit" -> `review`
- "Write tests for this app" -> `test`
- "Create the test data for these scenarios" -> `test`
- "Do these tests actually catch bugs?" -> `test`
- "Create business and technical docs from existing code" -> `backward`
- "The upload file broke — the columns are different now" -> `input`
- "We get a new CSV layout next month, adapt the app to the new data" -> `input`
- "I want to build something but I'm not sure what I need" -> `brief`
- "Interview me about my project" / "help me write the spec" -> `brief`
- "Deploy this to staging" / "get it running on our server" -> `deploy`
- "What do I need to run this in production?" -> `deploy`

## Mode Summary

### `brief`
Purpose: Interview the user, produce the LEX project contract, and route to the
mode that does the work. **This is the default mode.**

Use when:
- Nothing says otherwise. It is where a session starts.
- The user does not yet have a clear specification, or asks for help producing one.
- Their request could reasonably mean more than one kind of run.
- You want the outcome, actors, workflow, business rules, boundaries, and
  definition of done captured before any build mode starts.

Shape: flat and conversational — no step loop. The server hands the assistant one
question at a time; the assistant does the talking. Answers are validated per
field, so a filler answer is refused with a sharper follow-up to ask instead, and
every answer records whether the user decided it or the assistant assumed it.

Routing: the **first** question (`routing.intent`) asks which kind of run this is,
offering one option per mode. It is asked, not inferred — its answer fixes the
target mode, the entry tool, and how much of the rest of the interview applies.
`kickstart_brief` takes an optional `scenario`, but it arrives as a *proposal* the
user confirms rather than as an answer: pass your read of it when their words make
it obvious, omit it when they do not. The server refuses to record this field as
`agent_assumed`, so a guess nobody confirmed cannot be finalized. Until it is
answered, `scenario` is `""`, `hands_off_to` is `null`, no contract is written, and
`finalize_brief` / `skip_topic` / `finish_interview_now` / `open_interview_form`
all refuse.

Output: `.lex/contract.md` (the answers, hand-editable) and `.lex/prompt.md` (a
standalone contract prompt). Nothing is built, committed, or run.

Handoff: the answered scenario pins the build mode. `finalize_brief` returns it in
`hands_off_to`, and every entry tool takes a `contract_path`, so the build mode
reads `.lex/contract.md` rather than re-asking.

Primary tools:
- `kickstart_brief`, `get_next_question`, `submit_answer`, `skip_topic`,
  `get_brief_status`, `finalize_brief`
- `open_interview_form` on request, when the user would rather fill in a form
  than answer in the chat

### `forward`
Purpose: Full project creation workflow.

Use when:
- Building a new Lex app from scratch.
- Running the full planning -> implementation -> hardening -> technical-map flow.

Primary tools:
- `kickstart_workflow`, `get_plan_step`, `notify_step_complete`, `finalize_workflow`

### `backward`
Purpose: Reverse documentation and migration workflow for existing projects.

Use when:
- Project already exists and needs structured documentation.
- You need scanner/wiki/questionnaire/business docs generation.

Primary tools:
- `reverse_kickstart`, `scan_project`, `generate_wiki`, `generate_questionnaire`, `submit_questionnaire`

### `edit`
Purpose: Targeted modification workflow for existing Lex projects.

Use when:
- Applying focused changes to an existing Lex app.
- Running a task-catalog driven edit session with explicit artifacts.

Shape: flat and task-catalog driven — no step loop. You pick the smallest set of
code-change tasks the request actually touches; the server auto-injects the
sustainability tasks those picks trigger (Lex compliance, dependent-code scan,
tests, docs and technical-map sync, migration checks). `lex-compliance-check`
cannot be waived, and neither can `migration-check` when a model-shaped change
requires it; the rest need a written rationale through `waive_task`.

Git: the server owns it, and is the only writer on the run's branch — do not run
git yourself. `kickstart_edit` cuts `<project-slug>/edit-NN-<change-slug>`,
`notify_task_complete` commits that task as `[edit/<task_id>] <summary>`, and
`finalize_edit` commits the report, pushes the branch, and opens a pull request
against the base branch. It does not merge: several edit runs can be open on one
base at a time, so that is a person's call. A project that is not a git repository
still runs and simply commits nothing.

Parallel runs: one run per checkout. A second `kickstart_edit` where a run is
already active returns `ok: false` with `action_required: "move_to_worktree"` and
the path of a worktree the server has already created and seeded. Concurrent runs
share a base branch so their diffs compose. `docs/mcp-execution-model.md` has the
full mechanism, including which environments offer worktrees natively.

Output: `edits/<run_id>/` in the project (per-task artifacts and
`EDIT-REPORT.md`), committed to the run's branch. Session state lives in
`.lex-edit/runs/<run_id>.json`, one file per run, and is never committed.

Primary tools:
- `kickstart_edit`, `list_edit_tasks`, `propose_edit_plan`, `set_edit_plan`,
  `get_task_brief`, `notify_task_complete`, `waive_task`, `get_edit_status`,
  `finalize_edit`
- All of those except `kickstart_edit` and `list_edit_tasks` take an optional
  `run_id`, needed only when more than one run is open in the server

### `review`
Purpose: Static review/audit workflow for existing Lex projects.

Use when:
- Running compliance, architecture, code-quality, or risk reviews.
- You need review reports, not implementation changes.

Primary tools:
- `kickstart_review`, `list_review_types`, `get_review_brief`, `notify_review_complete`, `finalize_review`

### `test`
Purpose: Write the test suite for an existing Lex project and prove it works.

Use when:
- Writing tests, test scenarios, or test data for a Lex app.
- Auditing whether an existing suite would actually catch a regression.
- Setting up `lex_test_config.yaml` group selection.

Shape: flat and autonomous, like `review` — no step loop. The orchestrator is
handed every responsibility test mode owns and picks the ones the project needs.

Hard prerequisite: the project must already have LEX-AI-style user stories
(`plans/technical_docs/step-03-user-stories.md` from forward, or
`plans/business_docs/business/03-user-journeys.md` from backward). Every
assertion has to trace back to a stated acceptance criterion, so
`kickstart_test_run` refuses without them and `dispatch_reverse_prerequisite`
runs the backward workflow first, then hands control back to test mode.

Primary tools:
- `kickstart_test_run`, `dispatch_reverse_prerequisite`, `list_responsibilities`,
  `propose_test_plan`, `set_test_plan`, `get_responsibility_brief`,
  `record_scenario_matrix`, `notify_responsibility_complete`,
  `waive_responsibility`, `record_test_execution`, `get_test_status`,
  `finalize_test_run`

### `input`
Purpose: Adapt an existing Lex App to a changed input-data format.

Use when:
- The input files changed shape: renamed, added, or dropped columns, a new
  delimiter or encoding, a new row grain, or restructured upload files.
- The app's upload parsing no longer matches the incoming data. A Lex App's
  input parsing is hand-written pandas code inside upload models'
  `calculate()` methods, so a format change is a code migration.

Shape: flat like `review` and `edit` — no coordinator loop and no mandatory
ordering; `kickstart_input_change` is the only mandatory first call. Intake is
dual-path: the user provides a sample file in the new format (CSV/TSV headers
sniffed server-side, XLSX inspected by the analyst agent) or describes the
change verbally, in which case the `lex-input-analyst` agent interviews the
user until the old-vs-new column mapping is unambiguous.

Output: `input-changes/` in the project (format spec, per-area change logs,
`_index.md`, and `INPUT-FORMAT-CHANGE-REPORT.md` written by finalize). Session state
lives in `.lex-input/manifest.json`. `finalize_input_change` warns when the
recommended areas (upload-parser, migrations, test-data) never completed.

Primary tools:
- `kickstart_input_change`, `register_format_change`, `get_intake_brief`,
  `list_change_areas`, `get_change_brief`, `notify_change_complete`,
  `get_input_change_status`, `finalize_input_change`

### `deploy`
Purpose: Get an existing Lex App running in a target environment.

Use when:
- The app is built and now has to run somewhere: local, staging, or production.
- The user asks what it takes to run it, or reports that a deployment is broken.

Shape: sequential, like `forward` — the step bodies come from the Lex deployment
handbook on the remote MCP and are run in order. Unlike `forward` and `edit`
there is no git: the server never commits or pushes, because a deployment run
touches credentials and infrastructure config.

Deployment used to be a hidden second process inside `forward` — a
`get_deployment_step` tool no payload advertised and a `process="deployment"`
arm in `notify_step_complete`. It only existed at the tail of a greenfield
build, which is the one moment nobody is deploying. It is a mode so it can be
reached on its own, repeatedly, against a project that already exists.

Secrets: this is the one mode that routinely touches real credentials. No
summary, note, index row, or report may contain a credential *value* — only the
key name and where it belongs. The user sets the values themselves.

Blocked steps are first-class: a step that stalls on a DNS record, a firewall
rule, or a credential is recorded `blocked` and the tool points back at that
same step rather than advancing past it. `finalize_deployment` returns every
blocked and partial step so a stalled run is never reported as finished.

Output: `deployment/` in the project (per-step notes, `_index.md`, and
`DEPLOYMENT-REPORT.md` written by finalize). Session state lives in
`.lex-deploy/manifest.json`.

Primary tools:
- `kickstart_deployment`, `get_deployment_step`,
  `notify_deployment_step_complete`, `get_deployment_status`,
  `finalize_deployment`

### `mvp_generator`
Purpose: Reduced-scope forward workflow focused on MVP delivery.

Use when:
- Building a minimal viable product with a constrained step sequence.
- You need faster delivery with narrower implementation scope.

Primary tools:
- `kickstart_mvp`, `list_mvp_checkpoints`, `submit_mvp_plan`, `submit_mvp_scope`, `scaffold_mvp`, `record_implementation`, `run_boot_checklist`, `finalize_mvp`

### `mvp_completion`
Purpose: Upgrade an MVP project to final/full-product scope.

Use when:
- A reduced-scope project exists and you want completion/expansion to full
  product quality.
- You need the completion-mode orchestration and wiki sync phases.

Precondition: steps 9-19 read the forward planning artefacts under
`plans/technical_docs/` — `step-00-overview.md` through
`step-08-rule-validation.md`. **An MVP run does not create them.** MVP mode
writes `mvp/<run_id>/` and nothing under `plans/`, so coming from an MVP the
user has to write those planning documents by hand first. Check the directory
before switching, and say so if it is empty rather than starting a loop that
reads nothing.

Primary tools:
- Completion variants of `kickstart_workflow`, `get_plan_step`, `notify_step_complete`, `finalize_workflow`

## Switching Guidance

1. Confirm user intent explicitly before switching modes.
2. Quote the user intent in the switch tool's `user_request` argument. `switch_to_mode`
   requires `confirm_mode_switch=true` and at least ten characters of
   `user_request`, and refuses without both — do not synthesise it to satisfy the
   gate. If you cannot quote the user, you do not have their decision.
3. Use `force=True` only when a guarded transition explicitly requires it and the user approved.
4. After switching, wait for tools to refresh before calling new-mode tools.
5. Every mode can target every other mode, `brief` included. Switch back to
   `brief` when the user's next request belongs to a different mode and you cannot
   tell which, or when the mode it implies would need requirements they have not
   stated. That round trip is the intended path, not a fallback.

## Notes For AI Agents

- Prefer reading this file when deciding mode transitions.
- Keep switch tool descriptions short and defer detailed explanation to this document.
- Do not switch modes just to bypass errors; resolve workflow requirements first.
