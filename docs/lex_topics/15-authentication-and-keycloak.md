## Scope

- Auth model and role/scope system
- Environment-driven configuration and profile mapping

## Key Points

- Lex uses Keycloak-integrated authentication and scope-based authorization.
- Permission model combines model/resource scopes with user/client role context.
- Environment variables define issuer/client/realm integration settings.
- Auth context feeds into `UserContext` and serializer permission filtering.

## LLM Prompt Starters

- "Given these scopes/roles, determine allowed operations for this model and explain briefly."
